\begin{document}

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
Include no author information in the initial submission, to facilitate
blind review.  The abstract should be one paragraph, indented 1/8~inch on both sides,
in 9~point font with single spacing. The heading ``{\bf Abstract}''
should be 10~point, bold, centered, with one line of space below
it. This one-paragraph abstract section is required only for standard
six page proceedings papers. Following the abstract should be a blank
line, followed by the header ``{\bf Keywords:}'' and a list of
descriptive keywords separated by semicolons, all in 9~point font, as
shown below.

\textbf{Keywords:} 
add your choice of indexing terms or keywords; kindly use a
semicolon; between each term
\end{abstract}


\section{General Formatting Instructions}

The entire content of a paper (including figures, references, and anything else) can be no longer than six pages in the \textbf{initial submission}. In the \textbf{final submission}, the text of the paper, including an author line, must fit on six pages. Up to one additional page can be used for acknowledgements and references.

The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns with an
overall width of 7 inches (17.8 cm) and length of 9.25 inches (23.5
cm), with 0.25 inches between the columns. Leave two line spaces
between the last author listed and the text of the paper; the text of
the paper (starting with the abstract) should begin no less than 2.75 inches below the top of the
page. The left margin should be 0.75 inches and the top margin should
be 1 inch.  \textbf{The right and bottom margins will depend on
  whether you use U.S. letter or A4 paper, so you must be sure to
  measure the width of the printed text.} Use 10~point Times Roman
with 12~point vertical spacing, unless otherwise specified.

The title should be in 14~point bold font, centered. The title should
be formatted with initial caps (the first letter of content words
capitalized and the rest lower case). In the initial submission, the
phrase ``Anonymous CogSci submission'' should appear below the title,
centered, in 11~point bold font.  In the final submission, each
author's name should appear on a separate line, 11~point bold, and
centered, with the author's email address in parentheses. Under each
author's name list the author's affiliation and postal address in
ordinary 10~point type.

Indent the first line of each paragraph by 1/8~inch (except for the
first paragraph of a new section). Do not add extra vertical space
between paragraphs.


\section{First Level Headings}

First level headings should be in 12~point, initial caps, bold and
centered. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4~line space
below the heading.


\subsection{Second Level Headings}

Second level headings should be 11~point, initial caps, bold, and
flush left. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4~line
space below the heading.


\subsubsection{Third Level Headings}

Third level headings should be 10~point, initial caps, bold, and flush
left. Leave one line space above the heading, but no space after the
heading.


\section{Formalities, Footnotes, and Floats}

Use standard APA citation format. Citations within the text should
include the author's last name and year. If the authors' names are
included in the sentence, place only the year in parentheses, as in
\citeA{NewellSimon1972a}, but otherwise place the entire reference in
parentheses with the authors and year separated by a comma
\cite{NewellSimon1972a}. List multiple references alphabetically and
separate them by semicolons
\cite{ChalnickBillman1988a,NewellSimon1972a}. Use the
``et~al.'' construction only after listing all the authors to a
publication in an earlier reference and for citations with four or
more authors.


\subsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes in 9~point font at the
bottom of the column on which they appear. Precede the footnote block
with a horizontal rule.\footnote{Sample of the second footnote.}


\subsection{Tables}

Number tables consecutively. Place the table number and title (in
10~point) above the table with one line space above the caption and
one line space below it, as in Table~\ref{sample-table}. You may float
tables to the top or bottom of a column, and you may set wide tables across
both columns.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center} 
\caption{Sample table title.} 
\label{sample-table} 
\vskip 0.12in
\begin{tabular}{ll} 
\hline
Error type    &  Example \\
\hline
Take smaller        &   63 - 44 = 21 \\
Always borrow~~~~   &   96 - 42 = 34 \\
0 - N = N           &   70 - 47 = 37 \\
0 - N = 0           &   70 - 47 = 30 \\
\hline
\end{tabular} 
\end{center} 
\end{table}


\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be very dark for purposes of reproduction and should
not be hand drawn. Number figures sequentially, placing the figure
number and caption, in 10~point, after the figure with one line space
above the caption and one line space below it, as in
Figure~\ref{sample-figure}. If necessary, leave extra white space at
the bottom of the page to avoid splitting the figure and figure
caption. You may float figures to the top or bottom of a column, and
you may set wide figures across both columns.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\fbox{CoGNiTiVe ScIeNcE}
\end{center}
\caption{This is a figure.} 
\label{sample-figure}
\end{figure}


\section{Acknowledgments}

In the \textbf{initial submission}, please \textbf{do not include
  acknowledgements}, to preserve anonymity.  In the \textbf{final submission},
place acknowledgments (including funding information) in a section \textbf{at
the end of the paper}.


\section{References Instructions}

Follow the APA Publication Manual for citation format, both within the
text and in the reference list, with the following exceptions: (a) do
not cite the page numbers of any book, including chapters in edited
volumes; (b) use the same format for unpublished references as for
published ones. Alphabetize references by the surnames of the authors,
with single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
references by the same authors by the year of publication, with the
earliest first.

Use a first level section heading, ``{\bf References}'', as shown
below. Use a hanging indent style, with the first line of the
reference flush against the left margin and subsequent lines indented
by 1/8~inch. Below are example references for a conference paper, book
chapter, journal article, dissertation, book, technical report, and
edited volume, respectively.
